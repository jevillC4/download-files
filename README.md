# _Web scraping_

## Through the web scraping,  I download files from the [Gnome](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/cat/) page, in this case full hd images, which I use as wallpapers.
## I developed this script, for practice and because I like to collect high resolution images  ^_^.

# _*NodeJs.*_

### Run
Node version 14.x.x
```
node index.js
```
