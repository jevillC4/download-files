# Web scraping

Through the web scraping, I download files from the [Gnome](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/cat/) page, in this case full hd images, which I use as wallpapers.

I developed this script, for practice and because I like to collect high resolution images ^\_^.

# NodeJs.

### configs

set the path where images are saved in the following file

./

.env

```
DIR=YOUR_PATH
```

### Run

Node version 14.x.x

```
node index.js
```
